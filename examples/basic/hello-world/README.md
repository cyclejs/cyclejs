# Cycle.js Hello World example

This is the smallest possible cycle.js program. It just echoes anything written
in the text field.

This is good for:

- Learning the basic structure of a cycle.js program
- Starting to think in streams
- Learning how to read events and write html to the DOM Driver

## Usage

1.  Type `npm start`
2.  Open the `index.html` in your browser, with the full path,
e.g. `file:///Users/myself/cyclejs/examples/basic/hello-world/index.html`
